# Sudoku App
This is a generic sudoku app build using .NET Blazor WASM.
Currently I'm using this to learn Blazor/wasm, so the code might not be that good.

## Quick setup
Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/). **Make sure to intall the component: `ASP.NET and web development`**.
- Any browser (Duh).

For more information do your own reasearch on ASP.NET, Blazor, etc.
